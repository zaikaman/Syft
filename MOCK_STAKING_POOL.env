# Features
- Accepts XLM token deposits via stake_tokens()
- Returns 1:1 staking ratio (get_staking_rate() = 1.0)
- Allows withdrawals via unstake_tokens()
- Tracks user balances and total staked amounts

# Implementation
The mock staking pool is deployed and initialized. It's now configured in:
backend/src/services/vaultDeploymentService.ts (line 537)

# Next Steps
1. Restart your backend service to pick up the new staking pool address
2. Deploy a new vault with staking rules - it will now use the real staking pool
3. Monitor transactions at the explorer link above to see staking in action
