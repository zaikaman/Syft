- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Issues Found

**Validation Results: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED**

No blocking issues found. All content quality, requirement completeness, and feature readiness criteria have been satisfied.

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- ✅ **Q1 - Social Sentiment Sources**: X/Twitter + Reddit selected for balanced coverage (real-time public sentiment + deeper crypto discussions)
- ✅ **Q2 - Backtest Privacy**: Private by default with optional publishing for marketplace listings (empowers experimentation while building trust)
- ✅ **Q3 - Vault Modification Rules**: Personal vaults remain flexible; shared vaults (with NFT shareholders) become immutable post-issuance (mirrors Morpho/Summer.fi governance patterns)

## Notes

- Spec is comprehensive with 6 prioritized user stories providing clear independent testing paths
- Edge cases are thorough and realistic for DeFi platform
- Success criteria are well-balanced between technical performance and business/user metrics
- Assumptions section properly documents dependencies and prerequisites
