# Tasks: Syft DeFi Yield Vault Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-syft-defi-platform/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úì, spec.md ‚úì, research.md ‚úì
**Feature Branch**: `001-syft-defi-platform`
**Timeline**: 10 days (MVP)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 6 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Wallet integration is entry point
- **User Story 5 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational + US6 (needs wallet for asset display)
- **User Story 1 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational + US6 + US5 (needs wallet + builder)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 (needs vault structure) - Can run parallel with US2
- **User Story 2 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 (needs vault structure) - Can run parallel with US3
- **User Story 4 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 (needs deployed vaults)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Critical Path (MVP)**:
1. Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US6 (Wallet) ‚Üí US5 (Builder) ‚Üí US1 (Vault Deploy) = **CORE MVP**

**Parallel After MVP**:
- US3 (Backtest) can develop in parallel with US2 (AI Suggestions) after US1 completes
- Both are independent and don't block each other

**Final Phase**:
- US4 (NFT Marketplace) requires US1 but can develop while US2/US3 are in progress

### Within Each User Story

 - Smart contract implementation before backend services (US1, US4)
- Backend services before frontend integration
- Core functionality before error handling and polish
- Story complete and independently tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003-T016 can run in parallel (different package.json files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 
- Tasks T018-T023 (database schemas) can run in parallel
- Tasks T024-T036 (middleware, utilities, UI components) can run in parallel after schemas

**Phase 5 (User Story 1)**:
- Contract-related tasks and implementation work (contracts, deployment services) can be executed in parallel where safe; implementation functions (T067-T069) should follow types (T066)
 - API endpoint tasks (T075-T083) can run in parallel after core contract interfaces (T074)

**Phase 6 (User Story 3)**:
- Tasks T095-T096 (data + simulation) can run in parallel
- Tasks T099-T100 (API endpoints) can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (User Story 2)**:
- Tasks T110-T111 (sentiment services) can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (User Story 4)**:
- Tasks T124-T126 (NFT contract) can run in parallel
- Tasks T128-T131 (API endpoints) can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (Polish)**:
- Almost all tasks (T141-T154) can run in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Implementation

```bash
# Week 1 Day 1-3: Parallel contract and API development
Developer A: "Implement vault initialization and core contract types (T066)"
Developer B: "Implement deposit and withdrawal functions (T068, T069)"
Developer C: "Implement backend deployment and monitor services (T075, T076)"

# Week 1 Day 4-5: Parallel API and frontend development
Developer A: "Create API endpoint POST /api/vaults (T079)"
Developer B: "Create API endpoint GET /api/vaults/:vaultId (T080)"
Developer C: "Frontend: VaultDeployment + VaultDashboard components (T085, T088)"

# Week 2: Manual verification and polish
All developers: Integrate components and run manual end-to-end checks
```

---

## Testing & CI/CD (deferred for MVP)

Formal automated testing and CI/CD tasks have been intentionally deferred to accelerate MVP delivery. Implementers should rely on lightweight sanity scripts and manual checklists during the fast iteration. Add automation later once core features (US6, US5, US1) are stable.


**Benefits**:
- Deliver value every 2-3 days
- Each story independently testable
- Can stop at any checkpoint for demo/launch
- Parallel development opportunities after MVP

### Parallel Team Strategy

**Optimal Team Size**: 3 developers + 1 designer

**Week 1 Allocation**:
- **Dev A**: Setup + Foundational (contracts focus)
- **Dev B**: Setup + Foundational (backend focus)
- **Dev C + Designer**: Setup + Foundational (frontend focus)

**Week 2 Allocation** (after Foundational complete):
- **Dev A**: Smart contracts (US1 vault contract)
- **Dev B**: Backend services (US1 monitoring + US6 wallet)
- **Dev C**: Frontend (US5 builder + US6 wallet UI)
- **Designer**: Visual builder components and UX

**Week 3+ Allocation** (post-MVP):
- **Dev A**: US3 (Backtest engine)
- **Dev B**: US2 (AI services)
- **Dev C**: US4 (NFT marketplace)

---

## Testing & CI/CD (MVP note)

Automated testing and CI/CD are intentionally deprioritized for the fast MVP. Use lightweight sanity scripts, local checks, and manual end-to-end verification during initial development. Add automation after core features (US6, US5, US1) stabilize.

---

## Risk Mitigation

Based on plan.md Risk Register:

| Risk | Tasks Addressing | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Soroban documentation gaps | T002, T066-T074 | Early prototype; use Stellar Discord; allow +1 day buffer |
| React Flow complexity | T052-T060 | Use community templates; prototype validation early (T053) |
| Prophet accuracy | T097 | Validate against real data; document uncertainty (T106) |
| Sentiment API rate limits | T110-T112, T116 | Implement caching (T116); queue requests |
| Timeline pressure | Entire plan | Strict MVP scope (US1+US5+US6); defer P2/P3 if needed |

---

## Success Metrics Validation

Tasks explicitly address spec.md Success Criteria:

- **SC-001** (10min vault creation): T037-T091 (complete flow)
- **SC-002** (30s wallet connect): T037-T046
-- **SC-003** (15s backtest): T095-T101 (backtest engine & endpoints)
- **SC-004** (60s rule execution): T077 (polling service)
-- **SC-005** (10s AI suggestions): T110-T116
- **SC-007** (99.5% uptime): T142 (monitoring)
- **SC-009** (70% deploy rate): T086-T091 (UX optimization)
- **SC-012** (90% success rate): T024, T029, T074, T091 (error handling)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
-- **QA note**: Formal automated test suites are deferred; maintain manual test checklists and sanity scripts for critical flows.
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- If timeline slips: Prioritize US1+US5+US6 (core MVP), defer US2-US4 to Phase 2

---

## Estimated Timeline

**Optimistic** (3 experienced devs, parallel execution): 10 days  
**Realistic** (2-3 devs, some sequential work): 12-14 days  
**Conservative** (learning curve, blockers): 15-18 days

**MVP Only** (US1+US5+US6): 7-10 days  
**Full Feature Set** (all user stories): 15-20 days
