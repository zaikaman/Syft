# Feature Specification: Syft DeFi Yield Vault Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-syft-defi-platform`  
**Created**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Syft is an innovative DeFi platform on Stellar that empowers users—from beginners to pros—to effortlessly craft, backtest, and deploy personalized yield vaults using a no-code drag-and-drop builder infused with AI co-pilot smarts. Leveraging Scaffold Stellar for rapid Rust/Wasm contract generation and TypeScript client integration, users pull in assets like XLM or USDC, define rules (e.g., auto-rebalance on APY dips or volatility spikes), and get AI-optimized suggestions drawn from on-chain data and X sentiment analysis—simulating returns up to 30% higher than static pools via zk-proofs for private testing. Once deployed, vaults mint shareable NFTs for co-investing in a vibrant marketplace, fostering community-driven TVL growth while integrating seamlessly with Stellar's AMM and Wallet Kit for one-click actions, all built in about 10 days to showcase composability and turn DeFi strategy design into an intuitive, viral game-changer."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Deploy Basic Yield Vault (Priority: P1)

A user connects their Stellar wallet, selects one or more assets (XLM, USDC) from their portfolio, defines basic rebalancing rules using a visual interface, and deploys their first functional yield vault that automatically manages their assets according to the defined strategy.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition and minimum viable product. Without the ability to create and deploy a vault, no other features have value. This demonstrates the platform's fundamental capability and provides immediate utility to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting a wallet with test assets, creating a vault with a single rebalancing rule (e.g., "rebalance when XLM drops below 40% allocation"), depositing assets, and verifying the vault executes the strategy correctly. Delivers immediate value by automating yield management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with a connected Stellar wallet containing XLM and USDC, **When** they access the vault builder interface, **Then** they see their available assets and can select one or more for their vault
2. **Given** a user has selected assets for their vault, **When** they use the visual rule builder to define a rebalancing condition (e.g., "rebalance when asset allocation shifts by 10%"), **Then** the rule is added to their vault configuration in plain language
3. **Given** a user has configured vault rules, **When** they initiate deployment, **Then** the vault contract is generated and deployed to Stellar, returning a unique vault identifier
4. **Given** a deployed vault, **When** the user deposits assets, **Then** the assets are locked in the vault and the vault begins monitoring for rule triggers
5. **Given** an active vault with assets, **When** market conditions trigger a defined rule, **Then** the vault automatically executes the rebalancing action without user intervention

### User Story 2 - AI-Assisted Strategy Optimization (Priority: P2)

A user working on vault configuration receives AI-generated suggestions for improving their strategy based on historical performance data, current market conditions, and sentiment analysis. The user can preview suggested optimizations and choose to apply them to their vault rules.

**Why this priority**: This differentiates Syft from basic vault platforms and accelerates user success. It's valuable but not essential for the core product—users can still create effective vaults manually. The AI co-pilot improves outcomes and reduces learning curve for beginners.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a vault with suboptimal rules, requesting AI suggestions, reviewing the recommendations with performance projections, and applying selected optimizations. Delivers value by improving vault performance without requiring deep DeFi expertise.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is configuring vault rules, **When** they request AI assistance, **Then** the system analyzes current configuration and presents 3-5 optimization suggestions with explanations
2. **Given** AI suggestions are displayed, **When** the user views a suggestion, **Then** they see the proposed rule changes, expected performance impact, and supporting data (historical trends, sentiment indicators)
3. **Given** multiple AI suggestions, **When** the user selects one to apply, **Then** the vault configuration is updated with the optimized rules while preserving any custom rules the user wants to keep
4. **Given** AI suggestions incorporate sentiment data, **When** significant social sentiment shifts are detected, **Then** the AI flags this as a risk factor or opportunity in its recommendations

---

### User Story 3 - Backtest Vault Strategy (Priority: P2)

A user with a configured vault strategy runs a backtest simulation against historical market data to see how their strategy would have performed over different time periods. The simulation provides performance metrics and identifies periods of strong or weak performance.

**Why this priority**: Backtesting builds user confidence before committing real assets and helps users refine strategies. It's a key feature for experienced DeFi users but not strictly necessary for basic vault operation. Users can deploy without backtesting, though it increases risk.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a vault strategy, selecting a historical time period (e.g., last 3 months), running the simulation, and receiving performance reports showing projected returns, drawdowns, and comparison to static holding. Delivers value by enabling risk-free strategy validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has configured vault rules, **When** they select the backtest option and choose a time period, **Then** the system simulates vault performance using historical asset prices and yields
2. **Given** a backtest is running, **When** the simulation completes, **Then** the user sees performance metrics including total return, volatility, maximum drawdown, and comparison to buy-and-hold strategy
3. **Given** backtest results are displayed, **When** the user reviews the timeline, **Then** they can see when specific rules triggered and how the vault rebalanced during that period
4. **Given** backtest results show underperformance, **When** the user modifies their strategy, **Then** they can immediately run a new backtest to compare results

### User Story 4 - Mint and Share Vault NFT (Priority: P3)

A user with a deployed vault mints an NFT representing shared ownership in their vault. The NFT can be listed in a marketplace where other users can purchase shares, allowing community co-investment while the original creator retains management rights.

**Why this priority**: This enables the social and marketplace aspects of Syft but is not required for core vault functionality. Users can create and benefit from vaults without NFT features. This priority allows initial users to test vault performance before opening to community investment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying a vault, minting an NFT with defined share allocation, listing it in the marketplace at a set price, having another user purchase shares, and verifying both parties receive appropriate profit distributions. Delivers value by enabling vault monetization and community building.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a deployed vault with positive performance, **When** they choose to mint a vault NFT, **Then** they specify the percentage of vault ownership to tokenize and the total number of shares
2. **Given** a vault NFT is minted, **When** the user lists it in the marketplace, **Then** other users can discover the vault, view its performance history, and see the asking price per share
3. **Given** a vault NFT is listed, **When** another user purchases shares, **Then** the ownership is transferred, the buyer receives their proportional NFT, and both parties can track vault performance
4. **Given** multiple users co-own a vault via NFTs, **When** the vault generates yields, **Then** profits are automatically distributed proportional to each owner's share percentage

### User Story 5 - Visual Vault Builder Interface (Priority: P1)

A user with no programming knowledge uses a drag-and-drop interface to design their vault strategy by connecting visual blocks representing assets, conditions, and actions. The interface provides real-time validation and plain-language descriptions of the resulting strategy.

**Why this priority**: This is essential to Syft's "no-code" value proposition and accessibility for beginners. Without the visual builder, the platform would require technical knowledge, eliminating the target audience of non-technical users. This is part of the core MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a vault using only visual components (dragging asset blocks, condition blocks, action blocks), connecting them to form a strategy, seeing real-time validation feedback, and verifying the generated vault contract executes the visual strategy correctly. Delivers immediate value by making DeFi accessible to non-developers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the vault builder, **When** they view the component palette, **Then** they see categorized blocks for Assets (XLM, USDC), Conditions (APY thresholds, volatility triggers, time-based), and Actions (rebalance, stake, provide liquidity)
2. **Given** available building blocks, **When** the user drags an asset block onto the canvas, **Then** the block displays current balance, price, and available actions for that asset
3. **Given** asset blocks on the canvas, **When** the user drags a condition block and connects it to assets, **Then** the connection creates a rule (e.g., "When XLM volatility exceeds 15%")
4. **Given** a condition is configured, **When** the user connects an action block, **Then** the complete rule is formed (e.g., "When XLM volatility exceeds 15%, rebalance to 50/50 allocation") and displayed in plain language
5. **Given** a partially configured strategy, **When** the user creates an invalid connection (e.g., incompatible block types), **Then** the system prevents the connection and shows a helpful error message
6. **Given** a complete vault strategy on the canvas, **When** the user previews the configuration, **Then** they see a summary in plain language describing what the vault will do

### User Story 6 - One-Click Wallet Integration (Priority: P1)

A new user visits Syft for the first time, clicks a connect button, authenticates via their existing Stellar wallet (Freighter, Albedo, or other), and immediately sees their assets available for vault creation—all within 30 seconds without any manual configuration.

**Why this priority**: Seamless wallet integration is the entry point to the platform. Without it, users cannot access any features. This is a critical part of the MVP and essential for achieving the "effortless" user experience promised in the vision.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visiting Syft with no prior account, clicking "Connect Wallet", completing wallet authentication, and verifying asset balances appear immediately in the vault builder. Delivers instant value by removing onboarding friction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits Syft without a connected wallet, **When** they click the "Connect Wallet" button, **Then** they see a list of supported Stellar wallets (Freighter, Albedo, etc.)
2. **Given** wallet options are displayed, **When** the user selects their wallet, **Then** the wallet extension/app prompts for authentication approval
3. **Given** the user approves wallet connection, **When** authentication completes, **Then** Syft displays their public address and automatically fetches their asset balances
4. **Given** a connected wallet, **When** the user returns to Syft later, **Then** their session is maintained and they don't need to reconnect (until session expiry or manual disconnect)
5. **Given** a connected wallet, **When** the user initiates any transaction (deploy vault, deposit assets), **Then** the wallet prompts for transaction approval with clear details

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to create a vault with insufficient assets to meet minimum deposit requirements?
- How does the system handle backtest requests for time periods with incomplete historical data?
- What happens when market conditions trigger multiple conflicting rules simultaneously (e.g., one rule says rebalance, another says hold)?
- How does the system behave when a user tries to withdraw assets while a vault is mid-rebalancing?
- What happens when sentiment data sources are unavailable or return conflicting signals?
- How does the platform handle vault NFT transfers if the original creator's wallet becomes inaccessible?
- What happens when network congestion on Stellar delays vault transaction execution beyond the optimal trigger time?
- How does the system handle a scenario where a user's vault strategy would require assets they don't have (e.g., needs USDC but only has XLM)?
- What happens when multiple users try to purchase the same limited vault NFT shares simultaneously?
- How does the platform handle vaults that consistently underperform—are there automatic safeguards or notifications?
